## Quickstart

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/osmond/plant-tracker.git
cd plant-tracker

# Copy the sample config and add your OpenWeather key
cp config.example.php config.php

# Start a local server
php -S localhost:8000
```
Open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser to begin.

## Configuration

Edit `config.php` and provide:

- `openweather_key` ‚Äì your OpenWeather API key
- `location` ‚Äì city name used for weather lookups
- `ra`, `kc` and mapping values for water calculations

Database credentials are taken from the environment variables `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS` and `DB_NAME`.

## Usage

1. Click **Add Plant** to create a new entry.
2. Upload a photo and fill out the care schedule.
3. View upcoming tasks in the calendar and drag them to reschedule.

Uploaded images are stored in `uploads/` and automatically converted to WebP when possible.

## FAQ

**Where do I get my API key?** Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and copy your key into `config.php`.

**Do I need a database?** The app requires MySQL or MariaDB for storing plant data. The test suite uses a stub database so you can run the tests without one.
